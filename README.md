# Tiny Item Animations

A Minecraft mod that adds a cute little animation when you pick up items with your mouse.

This mod is client-side, and supports NeoForge and Fabric (and likely Quilt, but I don't test it there).

## Installation

Grab the mod from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/tiny-item-animations).

You are [not allowed](https://github.com/Trivaxy/Tiny-Item-Animations/blob/multiloader-1.21/LICENSE) to re-upload this mod to any platform without explicit permission.

## Issues

Feel free to report any issues you find - but bear in mind I give priority to game-breaking bugs. Other issues may take a while (if ever) to be fixed.

## Contributions

I'm open to contributions, but please open an issue first. Don't open sudden PRs without a discussion.

In general, this mod's scope is intentionally limited. If you're trying to add a feature it's likely that I won't accept it.

P.S. Please don't ask me to port this to Forge. Support for it was dropped for a reason.
